Running the Django Project
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the command python manage.py runserver to start the server.
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ to access the website.
To access the admin panel, go to http://localhost:8000/admin and enter your login credentials (if you have created a superuser account using the command python manage.py createsuperuser).
That's it! You should now be able to run the Django project and access the admin panel. If you encounter any issues, feel free to check the Django documentation or reach out to the project maintainers for support.
